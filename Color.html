            <p>The Game Boy Color[a] (commonly abbreviated as GBC) is a handheld game console, manufactured by Nintendo, which was released in Japan on October 21, 1998[5] and to international markets that November. It is the successor to the Game Boy and is part of the Game Boy family.[4]

                The GBC features a color screen rather than monochrome, but it is not backlit. It is slightly thicker and taller and features a slightly smaller screen than the Game Boy Pocket, its immediate predecessor in the Game Boy line. </p>
