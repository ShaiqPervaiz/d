    <p>Excluding Classic Game Boy systems and Game Boy Micro, all devices in the Game Boy family are backwards compatible with every game produced for a previous console in the family with only a few exceptions. Classic Game Boy systems are forwards compatible with all black cartridge Game Boy Color games, but will not display them in color. This was accomplished through use of cartridges with similar hardware on later consoles in the family.

        The Game Boy line was succeeded by the Nintendo DS line. A number of Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games have been rereleased digitally through the Virtual Console service for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.
        
        The original Game Boy (ゲームボーイ, Gēmu Bōi) and Game Boy Color combined[5] sold 118.69 million units worldwide.[3] All versions of the Game Boy Advance family combined have sold 81.51 million units.[3] All Game Boy systems combined have sold 200.20 million units worldwide.
